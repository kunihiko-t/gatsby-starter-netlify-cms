I've used my redux-observable boilerplate frequently when starting development, and it's became a bit old.

So I've decided to migrate it to TypeScript + Hooks + Rxjs 6.
I'm leaving the record for my own review, and for the people who is trying to do similar things.

By the way, the result is this repository.
